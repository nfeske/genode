 *
 * The GIM KVM device is a mechanism for providing a stable time source
 * to the guest. The hypervisor provides a pair of TSC value, nanosecond
 * value along with a conversion factor (TSC <-> nanosecond) to the guest.
 *
 * - The values are communicated on memory shared between guest and VMM
 *
 * - The location of the guest-physical address is picked by the guest
 *   and propagated to the hypervisor via the MSR MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME_NEW
 *   (0x4b564d01).
 *
 * - The values on the shared page are supposed to be periodically updated.
 *   Apparently, VirtualBox updates the values only when the MSR is written.
