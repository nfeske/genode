Genode on top of the Muen separation kernel
###########################################

_This section was written by Adrian-Ken Rueegsegger and Reto Buerki who_
_conducted the described line of work independent from Genode Labs._

After completing our x86_64 port of the Genode base-hw kernel, which was
featured in the previous release (15.05), we immediately started working on our
main goal: running a Genode system as guest on the Muen Separation Kernel (SK)
to benefit from the rich ecosystem of Genode.

For those who have not read the 15.05 Genode release notes, [http://muen.sk - Muen]
is an Open-Source microkernel, which uses the [http://spark-2014.org/ - SPARK]
programming language to enable light-weight formal methods for high assurance.
The 64-bit x86 kernel, currently consisting of a little over 5'000 LOC, makes
extensive use of the latest Intel virtualization features and has been formally
proven to contain no runtime errors at the source-code level.

The new 'hw_x86_64_muen' platform, as the name implies, extends the 'hw_x86_64'
base-hw kernel by replacing the PIC and timer drivers with paravirtualized
variants.

In contrast to other kernels supported by Genode, the architecture with Muen is
different in the sense that the entire 'hw_x86_64_muen' Genode system runs as
guest VM in VMX non-root mode on the SK. From the perspective of Muen, Genode
is executed on top of the kernel like any other guest OS without special
privileges.

This loose coupling of Muen and Genode base-hw enables the robust combination
of a static, low-complexity SK with a feature-rich and extensive OS framework.
The result is a flexible platform for the construction of component-based
high-assurance systems.

People interested in giving the 'hw_x86_64_muen' platform a spin can find a
small tutorial at _repos/base-hw/doc/x86_64_muen.txt_.


NOVA kernel-resource management
###############################

The NOVA kernel serves Genode on x86 as a main platform since the last years,
mainly because of two reasons. On the one hand the kernel provides, among the
supported x86 kernels, the richest hardware feature set like the support of
IOMMUs, virtualization and SMP. On the other hand the design of the
kernel, the stable kernel interface, the available kernel interface
specification, the readable and modern source base is a pleasure to work with.
Because of all the reasons Genode Labs is and was able to maintain and extend
the kernel.

Nevertheless the vanilla kernel lacks one essential feature since the beginning
to reliable host Genode as user-land, namely the kernel memory management. In
the past we extended the kernel already to free up kernel resources when they
get destructed, e.g. processes and the page-tables, threads, semaphores and
portals.

Still, on Genode/NOVA a process may trigger arbitrary kernel memory consumption
during RPC by delegating memory or capabilities or by creating processes and
threds via Genode's core. If the kernel memory gets depleted, the kernel panics
with a "Out of memory" message and the overall Genode scenario stops.

The consumption can be in principal triggered by any deliberately misbehaving
respectively greedy process. Unfortunately this happens normal day-to-day
usage of Genode, e.g. compiling and linking source code in Genode's Noux
environment. Our nightly test compiling Genode in Noux on Genode/NOVA already
triggers this from time to time.

The main issue here is that the kernel memory consumption are not and can not
be accounted and limited by Genode, because the kernel interface does not
support such a feature. Kernels like seL4 as Genode's own base-hw kernel shows
how this can be solved.

To improve the current situation - where the overall kernel memory amount is
fixed - we extended the kernel during the last release in the following ways.

First - the NOVA kernel accounts any kernel memory consumption per process.
Second - every process has a limited amount of kernel memory quota it can use.
Third - the kernel detects when the quota limit of a process is reached.

The kernel may notify another thread (if configured so) about this situation,
otherwise the thread causing the situation gets stopped.
The so called - out-of-memory(OOM) - handler thread gets information about the
situation and may react on it. Possible reactions can be for example to:

- either stop the thread of the process or
- transfer kernel memory quota between processes (upgrading the limit if desired) or
- free up kernel memory if possible, e.g. revoke memory delegations which can be re-created

The steps above we implemented in the NOVA kernel and extended Genode's core
to handle such OOM situations. All syscalls beside the IPC call/reply may
now return a error code which specifies that the quota was insufficient. These
syscalls are solely done and permitted by core and handled inside the base-nova
specific platform code.

In the case of IPC call/reply we wanted to handle OOM cases however
transparently to the Genode user applications. Therefore every thread in
Genode/NOVA now gets constructed with a OOM IPC-Portal attached. This portal
is served by the pager thread in core and gets called, when a OOM situation is
detected during IPC call/reply. If the pager thread receives such a OOM IPC,
it decodes the involved IPC sender and IPC receiver and looks up the
appropriate core internal Genode paging objects.

The current implemented out-of-memory policy of the OOM handling code of the
pager thread first tries to upgrade the quota. If this is not possible anymore
the second attempt is to revoke some user-memory of the OOM causing process
and therefore implicitly to free-up some kernel memory. If none of the
reactions succeeds the causing thread can be stopped by the pager.

The current policy implementation at the moment is a rather rough heuristic,
which does not suffice all needs. At this point one would like to specify per
process a policy, e.g. depending on the typical known memory usage pattern.
For example some processes should only have a static usage pattern, and
therefore a hard fixed upper quota limit. Other processes are highly dynamic
and there some quota upgrades to some degree are desired. There are a lot of
more combinations imaginable.

Our plan for now is to collect some experience over the next months with the
new kernel OOM mechanism. Based on the observations we may externalize such
policy decisions outside core and make it possibly configurable per Genode
process.

The current state of the integration of the extended NOVA kernel with core
however already avoids the situation that the whole kernel goes out-of-service
if a process behaves kernel-memory-wise greedy.

Interactive management of subsystem configurations
==================================================

commit b4ebefd616f15c00c6f3f53a47e46f814c7e2ef6
Author: Norman Feske <norman.feske@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 27 17:05:45 2015 +0100

    cli_monitor: read subsystem configs from VFS
    
    This patch changes the way how CLI monitor obtains its subsystem
    configurations. Originally, this information was provided via the
    Genode::config mechanism. But for managing complex scenarios, the config
    node becomes very complex. Hence, it is preferrable to have a distinct
    file for each subsystem configuration.
    
    The CLI monitor scans the directory '/subsystems' for files ending with
    ".subsystem". Each file has the same syntax as the formerly used
    subsystem nodes.

Window management improvements

    decorator: consider partially transparent windows
    
    This patch changes the window manager, the decorator, and the
    floating window layouter to propagate the usage of an alpha channel from
    the client application to the decorator. This way, the decorator can
    paint the decoration elements behind the affected windows, which would
    otherwise be skipped.

Base framework and low-level OS infrastructure
##############################################

Improved audio support
======================

In the previous release we replaced the old audio driver with a new one
that also provided the Audio_out service. In line with the Audio_out
session we are now introducing a new Audio_in session interface that can be
used to record audio frames. It is modelled after the Audio_out interface in
the way how it handles the communication between the client and the server.
It also uses shared memory in form of the Audio_in::Stream to transport the
frames between them. A server component captures frames and puts them into a
packet queue, which is embedded in the Audio_in::Stream. The server allocates
packets from this queue to store the recorded audio frames. If the queue is
already full, the server will override already allocated packets and will notify
the client by submitting the 'overrun' signal. The client has to cope with this
situation, e.g., by saving packets more frequently. A client can install a
signal handler to react on the 'progress' signal, which is send by the server
when a new Audio_in::Packet was submitted to the packet queue. For now all
Audio_in server components only support one channel (left) although the
Audio_in session interface itself supports multiple channels.

The dde_bsd audio_drv is the first and currently only audio driver component
that was extended to provide the Audio_in session. To express this fact the
driver was renamed from 'audio_out_drv' to 'audio_drv'. In contrast to its
playback functionality, which is enabled by default, recording has to be enabled
explicitly by setting the configuration attribute 'recording' to 'yes'. If the
need arises playback may be disabled by setting 'playback' to 'no'. In addition,
it is now possible to configure the driver by adjusting the mixer in the
drivers configuration node. For the time being, the interface as employed by
the original OpenBSD mixer utility is used.

The following snippet shows how to enable and configure recording on an
Thinkpad X220 where the headset instead of the internal mic is used as
source:

! <start name="audio_out_drv">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
!   <provides>
!     <service name="Audio_out"/>
!     <service name="Audio_in"/>
!   </provides>
!   <config recording="yes">
!     <mixer field="outputs.master" value="255"/>
!     <mixer field="record.adc-0:1_source" value="sel2"/>
!     <mixer field="record.adc-0:1" value="255"/>
!   </config>
! </start>

In addition to selecting the recording source the playback as well as the
recording volume are raised to the maximum. Information about all available
mixers and settings in general may be obtained by specifying the 'verbose'
attribute in the config node.

The enriched driver is accompanied by a simple monitor application, which
directly plays all recorded audio frames back and shows how to use the
Audio_in session. It can be tested by executing the
_repos/dde_bsd/run/audio_in.run_ run script.

There are also changes to the Audio_out session itself. The length of a period
was reduced from 2048 to 512 samples to accommodate for a lower latency when
mixing Audio_out packets and a method for invalidating all packets in the
queue queue was added.


File-system infrastructure

    vfs: decouple file-system factory from libc
    
    This patch moves the VFS file-system factory to a separate vfs library
    that is independent from libc. This enables libc-less Genode programs to
    easily use the VFS infrastructure.

    VFS: local ram_fs instances
    
    Move FS Node implementations from server/ram_fs to include/ram_fs.
    Support embedded ram_fs instances in VFS configurations using <ram/>.
    Add 'no space' handling to VFS symlink ops.
    
    Fixes #1635

; proposal by emery:
;
;During different file system dependent experiments a need for private,
;temporary areas arose. This lead to a quick conversion of the ram_fs server
;core to an embeddable VFS file system. This addition to the set of VFS plugins
;allows processes to create, modify, and remove files without defining and
;allocating resources to an additional component. More embeddable versions of
;the dedicated file system servers can be expected in later releases as the use
;of the VFS evolves.


Unified networking components
=============================

Having had a good experience with our Block::Driver implementation, which wraps
the block-session interface and takes care of the packet stream handling, thus
easing the implementation of driver and other block components, we observed that
this approach did not provide enough flexibility for NIC-session servers. For
example, NIC servers are two directional and when a network packet arrives the
server has to make sure that there are enough resources available to dispatch
the network packet to the client. This has to be done because the server cannot
wait for allocations or an empty spot in the packet queue of a client.
Therefore, the server wants to check these conditions before dispatching the
packet and if they cannot be met it will usually drop the network packet.

In order the implement this kind a behavior, NIC-session servers must have
direct access to the actual NIC session. For this reason, we removed the
Nic::Driver interface from Genode and added a Nic::Session_component that offers
some basic packet-stream-signal dispatch functionality. Servers may now inherit
from this component and implement there own policy.

We adjusted all servers that implement NIC sessions to the new interface
(dde_ipxe, wifi, usb, nic_bridge, OpenVPN, ...), and thus unified all networking
components within Genode.


Enhanced tracing facilities

    core: provide thread exec times via TRACE service
    
    This patch enable clients of core's TRACE service to obtain the
    execution times of trace subjects (i.e., threads). The execution time is
    delivered as part of the 'Subject_info' structure.
    
    Right now, the feature is available solely on NOVA. On all other base
    platforms, the returned execution times are 0.

    core: throw Trace::Out_of_metadata in subjects()
    
    While importing trace sources as trace subjects into a TRACE session,
    the session quota might become depleted. The TRACE session already keeps
    track of the session quota via an allocator guard but the 'subjects' RPC
    function missed to handle the out-of-memory condition. This patch
    reflects the error condition as an 'Out_of_metadata' exception to the
    TRACE client. It also contains an extension of the trace test to
    exercise the corner case.

    base: use proper Cpu_session when tracing threads
    
    Up to now it was not possible to trace threads that use a different
    Cpu_session rather than env()->cpu_session() (as done by VirtualBox).
    This problem is now solved by setting the Cpu_session explicitly when
    creating the event logger and attaching the trace control area when
    creating the thread.
    
    Fixes #1618.

Device drivers
##############

Completing the transition to the new platform driver
====================================================

Until now the ACPI and PCI driver form on x86 the platform driver, whereby
the ACPI driver started the PCI driver as slave service. The ACPI
driver parsed the ACPI tables and provided the relevant information as
configuration during PCI driver startup. We changed this close interaction
to the more modern and commonly used report_rom Genode mechanism.

When the new ACPI driver finishes the ACPI table parsing, it provides the 
information via a Genode report to any interested and registered component.
The PCI driver is such a component, which gets connected via the Genode
configuration as a consumer of the ACPI report. The report contains e.g.
the IRQ re-routing information.

With the change of the interaction of ACPI and PCI driver the policy for
devices must be configured solely with the PCI driver and not anymore with the
ACPI driver. The syntax, however, stayed the same as introduced with release
15.05.

Finally the PCI driver 'pci_drv' got renamed to 'platform_drv' as used on most
ARM platforms already. All files and session interfaces containing PCI/pci in
the names get renamed to PLATFORM/platform. The x86 platform interfaces now
reside in 'repos/os/include/platform/x86/' and the implementation of the
platform driver in 'repos/os/src/drivers/platform/x86/'.

A example x86 platform configuration snippet looks like this:

!<start name="acpi_drv" >
! <resource .../>
! <route>
!  ...
!  <service name="Report"> <child name="acpi_report_rom"/> </service>
! </route>
!</start>
!
!<start name="acpi_report_rom" >
! <binary name="report_rom"/>
! <resource .../>
! <provides> <service name="ROM" /> <service name="Report" /> </provides>
! <config>
!  <rom> <policy label="platform_drv -> acpi" report="acpi_drv -> acpi"/> </rom>
! </config>
! <route> ... </route>
!</start>
!
!<start name="platform_drv" >
! <resource name="RAM" quantum="3M" constrain_phys="yes"/>
! <provides> <service name="Platform"/> </provides>
! <route>
!  <service name="ROM">
!   <if-arg key="label" value="acpi"/> <child name="acpi_report_rom"/>
!  </service>
!  ...
! </route>
! <config>
!  <policy label="ps2_drv"> <device name="PS2"/> </policy>
!  <policy label="nic_drv"> <pci class="ETHERNET"/> </policy>
!  <policy label="fb_drv"> <pci class="VGA"/> </policy>
!  <policy label="wifi_drv"> <pci class="WIFI"/> </policy>
!  <policy label="usb_drv"> <pci class="USB"/> </policy>
!  <policy label="ahci_drv"> <pci class="AHCI"/> </policy>
!  <policy label="audio_drv"> <pci class="AUDIO"/> <pci class="HDAUDIO"/> </policy>
! </config>
!</start>

In order to unify and simplify the writing of test run scripts we added a
platform configuration to the file 'repos/base/run/platform_drv.inc'.
This may be included by any test run script in order to setup the platform
driver configuration.

The file provides the following functions: 'append_platform_drv_build_components',
'append_platform_drv_config', 'append_platform_drv_boot_modules'. The usage
of the functions add the necessary information to the 'build_components',
'config' and 'boot_modules' run variables. The platform_drv.inc takes also care
to distinguish between all the ARM/x86 platform and includes the necessary
pieces.

The body of a example run script looks like this:

! set build_components { ... }
!
! source ${genode_dir}/repos/base/run/platform_drv.inc
! append_platform_drv_build_components
!
! build $build_components
!
! create_boot_directory
!
! set config { ... }
!
! append_platform_drv_config
!
! append config { ... }
!
! install_config $config
!
! append_platform_drv_boot_modules
!
! build_boot_image $boot_modules
!
! run_genode_until ...


BCM57cxx network cards
======================

During Hack'n Hike 2015 we had access to a server that featured a Broadcom-
network card. Therefore Guido Witmond performed the first steps to enable
Broadcom's BCM 57cxx cards. With this preliminary work in place, we were quickly
able to perform the additional stops required to add BCM 57cxx support to
Genode.


VESA driver refinements
=======================

The VESA driver now reports the framebuffer width to the client instead of the
visible width. This fixes possible distortion if these widths differ, at the
cost that content in the right-most area might be invisible in such cases.

Dynamic adaptation to screen size changes
=========================================

VirtualBox now notifies the guest operating system about screen size changes
(for example if the user resizes a window which shows the guest framebuffer).
The VirtualBox Guest Editions can use this information to adapt the guest
framebuffer to the new size.

SMP support
===========

Guest operating systems can now use multiple virtual CPUs, which are
mapped to multiple host CPUs. The number of virtual CPUs can be configured
in the '.vbox' file.

Preliminary audio support
=========================

At some point using VirtualBox as a stop-gap solution for using Genode as ones
every day OS also envolves having the ability to handle audio.
With this release we address this matter by enabling preliminary audio
support in our VirtualBox port. A backend that uses the Audio_out and
a Audio_in session to playback and record sound samples was added. It disguises
itself as the OSS backend, that is already used by vanilla VirtualBox. The
reason for doing so is the fact that we do not want to maintain more patches
than are absolutely necessary. Since we are already FreeBSD in the eyes of
VirtualBox it makes things easier to just provide an implementation of the OSS
backend because this is also used when using FreeBSD as host system.
The audio support is complemented by adding the necessary drivers for the HDA
as well as the AC97 device models to our VirtualBox port.

For now, it is vital to have the guest OS configure the device model in a way
that favors the current implementation. For example, the way our VirtualBox
port currently works we cannot guarantee distortion free playback or recording
if the guest OS uses a period that is two short, typically 10ms or less.
There are also some issues with the mixing/filtering code in VirtualBox.
Therefore, we bypass it to get better audio quality. As a consquence of that
the device model of the VM has to use the same sample rate as is used by the
Audio_out and Audio_in sessions (44.1kHz), however.

Enabling audio support is done be adding

! <AudioAdapter controller="HDA" driver="OSS" enabled="true"/>

to the .vbox file manually or configuring the VM accordingly by using the GUI.

The reason why we talk about preliminary support is the fact that the current
state is lacking in robustness and audio quality and we are still working on
improving it.

    hw: load bender before kernel on grub too


Revised page-table handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the main advantages of the base-hw platform is that the memory trading
concept of Genode is universally applied even regarding kernel objects. For
instance, whenever a component wants to create a thread, it pays for the
thread's stack, UTCB, and even for the corresponding kernel object. The same
applies to the objects needed to manage the virtual address space of a
component with the single exception of page-tables.

Normally, when the quota, which was donated by a component to a specific
service, runs out, the component receives an exception next time it tries
to invoke the service. Then it can upgrade its quota.
Within the context of page-fault resolution this is especially difficult to do.
The allocation and thereby the shortage of memory gets revealed when the client
is faulting. Therefore, it is difficult to inform the component to first
transmit more quota before resolving the fault.

Instead of designing a sophisticated protocol between core and the other
components to solve this problem, we decided to simplify the current page-fault
resolution by using a static set of page-tables per component. Formerly,
page-tables were dynamically allocated from core's memory allocator. Now,
an array of page-tables gets allocated during construction of a protection
domain. When a component runs out of page-tables, all it's mapping get flushed,
and the page-tables are populated from scratch. This change greatly simplifies
the page-table handling inside of base-hw.


Dynamic interrupt mode setting on x86_64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On x86-based hardware, user-level device drivers have become able to specify
the trigger mode and polarity of the interrupts when requesting an IRQ
session. On ARM, those session parameters are ignored. This change enables the
x86_64 platform to support devices which use arbitrary trigger modes and
polarity settings, e.g. AHCI on QEMU and real hardware.


Fiasco.OC
=========

Genode's device-driver support when using the Fiasco.OC kernel as base platform
received an upgrade.

First, principle support for the Raspberry Pi was added. To make this
platform useful in practice, a working USB driver is important. I.e., the
network interface is connected via USB. Hence the USB driver got enabled for
Fiasco.OC, too. As a result, Genode's software stack can now be used on the
Raspberry Pi by using either our custom base-hw kernel or Fiasco.OC.

Second, support for the Odroid-X2 platform using the Exynos4412 SoC was added,
which includes the drivers for the clock management (CMU), power management
(PMU) as well as USB.

Thanks to Reinier Millo Sánchez and Alexy Gallardo Segura for having
contributed this line of work.


Removal of deprecated features
##############################

We dropped the support for the *ARM Versatile Express* board from the Genode
source tree to relieve our automated testing infrastructure from supporting
a platform that remained unused for more than two years.

The device driver environment kit (DDE Kit) was originally intended as
a common API among the execution environments of ported user-level device drivers.
However, over the course of the past years, we found that this approach could
not fulfill this premise while introducing a number of new problems.
We reported our experiences in the release notes of versions
[http://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/12.05#Re-approaching_the_Linux_device-driver_environment - 12.05] and
http://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/14.11#Roundup - 14.11].
To be able to remove the DDE-Kit API, we reworked the USB driver, our port of
the Linux TCP/IP stack, and the wireless driver accordingly.
