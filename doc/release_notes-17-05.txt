    run: support for accessing depot content
    
    Run scripts can use the new 'import_from_depot' function to incorporate
    archive content from the depot into a scenario. The function must be
    called after the 'create_boot_directory' function and takes any number
    of pkg, src, or raw archives as arguments. An archive is specified as
    depot-relative path of the form <user>/<type>/name. Run scripts may
    call 'import_from_depot' repeatedly.
    
    An argument can refer to a specific version of an archive or just the
    version-less archive name. In the latter case, the current version (as
    defined by a corresponding archive recipe in the source tree) is used.
    
    If a 'src' archive is specified, the run tool integrates the content of
    the corrsponding binary archive into the scenario. The binary archives
    are selected according the spec values as defined for the build directory.
    As of now, only x86_32 and x86_64 are supported by the 'depot_spec'
    function.

    gems: import run-script ingredients from depot
    
    This patch adjusts the interactive scenarios of the gems repository to
    use the depot. This has three immediate benefits. First, once the depot
    is populated with binary archives, the start time of the scenarios
    becomes very quick because most dependency checks and build steps are
    side-stepped. Second, the run scripts become more versatile. In
    particular, run scripts that were formerly supported on base-linux only
    (nit_fader, decorator, menu_view) have become usable on all base
    platforms that have a 'drivers_interactive' package defined. Finally,
    the run scripts have become much shorter.

New revision of the Genode Foundations book
===========================================

Genode underwent substantial changes over the coures of the past year. This
prompts us to update the "Genode Foundations" book to reflect the most current
state of the framework. Specifically, the changes since the last year's
edition are:

* The consolidation of the PD and RAM services of core,
* The assignment and trading of capability quotas,
* An extension of the getting-starting section with an example of a typical
  component skeleton and the handling of external events,
* New init-configuration features, including the use of unscoped labels,
  state report, service forwarding, and label rewriting,
* The use of kernel-agnostic build directories,
* A new under-the-hood description of the asynchronous parent-child interplay,
* An updated API reference

Completed component transition to modern API
============================================

One year ago, we profoundly
[https:/documentation/release-notes/16.05#The_great_API_renovation - overhauled Genode's API].
The modernized framework interface promotes a safe programming style that greatly
reduces the chances for memory-safety bugs, eases the assessment of the code
by shunning the use of global side effects, and models the internal state of
components in an explict way. We are happy to report that we have updated
almost all of Genode's over 400 components to the new API now, so that we can
fade out the deprecated legacies from our past.

Originally, we planned to drop the deprecated API altogether with the current
release. But we will hold on for one release cycle as we identified a few
components that we better replace by new implementations rather than updating
them, i.e., our old Mesa EGL back end that will be replaced in August, or a
few libc plugins that are superseded by the recently introduced VFS
infrastructure. By keeping the compatibility with the old API for a bit
longer, we are not forced to drop those components before their replacements
are in place.


Streamlining exception types
============================

During the organic evolution of the Genode API, we usually introduced
exception types as needed without a global convention. In particular
the exception types as thrown by RPC functions were usually defined
in the scope of the RPC interface. This approach ultimately led to a
proliferation of ambiguously named exception types such as
'Root::Quota_exceeded' and 'Ram_session::Quota_exceeded'.

With the current release, we replace the organically grown exception landscape
by a framework-wide convention. The following changes ease the error handling
(there are fewer exceptions to handle), alleviates the need to convert
exceptions along the session-creation call chain, and avoids possible aliasing
problems (catching the wrong type with the same name but living in a different
scope):

* RPC functions that demand a session-resource upgrade no longer reflect this
  condition via a session-specific exception but via the new 'Out_of_ram'
  or 'Out_of_caps' exception types, declared in _base/quota_quard.h_.

* The former 'Parent::Service_denied', 'Parent::Unavailable',
  'Root::Invalid_args', 'Root::Unavailable', 'Service::Invalid_args',
  'Service::Unavailable', and 'Local_service::Factory::Denied' types have
  been replaced by the single 'Service_denied' exception type defined in
  'session/session.h'.
  This simplification eliminates ambiguities and removes the need to convert
  exception types along the path of the session creation.

* The former 'Parent::Quota_exceeded', 'Service::Quota_exceeded', and
  'Root::Quota_exceeded' exceptions are covered by the single
  'Insufficient_ram_quota' exception type now.

* The 'Parent' interface has become able to distinguish between 'Out_of_ram'
  (the child's RAM is exhausted) and 'Insufficient_ram_quota' (the child's
  RAM donation does not suffice to establish the session).

* The 'Allocator::Out_of_memory' exception has become an alias for 'Out_of_ram'.

    This patch augments the existing session/session.h with useful types for
    the session creation:
    
    * The new 'Insufficient_ram_quota' and 'Insufficient_cap_quota'
      exceptions are meant to supersede the old 'Quota_exceeded' exception
      of the 'Parent' and 'Root' interfaces.
    
    * The 'Session::Resources' struct subsumes the information about the
      session quota provided by the client.
    
    * The boolean 'Session::Diag' type will allow sessions to operate in a
      diagnostic mode.
    
    * The existing 'Session_label' is not also available under the alias
      'Session::Label'.
    
    * A few helper functions ease the extraction of typed session arguments
      from the session-argument string.

    Capability quota accounting and trading
    
    This patch mirrors the accounting and trading scheme that Genode employs
    for physical memory to the accounting of capability allocations.
    
    Capability quotas must now be explicitly assigned to subsystems by
    specifying a 'caps=<amount>' attribute to init's start nodes.
    Analogously to RAM quotas, cap quotas can be traded between clients and
    servers as part of the session protocol. The capability budget of each
    component is maintained by the component's corresponding PD session at
    core.
    
    At the current stage, the accounting is applied to RPC capabilities,
    signal-context capabilities, and dataspace capabilities. Capabilities
    that are dynamically allocated via core's CPU and TRACE service are not
    yet covered. Also, the capabilities allocated by resource multiplexers
    outside of core (like nitpicker) must be accounted by the respective
    servers, which is not covered yet.
    
    If a component runs out of capabilities, core's PD service prints a
    warning to the log. To observe the consumption of capabilities per
    component in detail, the PD service is equipped with a diagnostic
    mode, which can be enabled via the 'diag' attribute in the target
    node of init's routing rules. E.g., the following route enables the
    diagnostic mode for the PD session of the "timer" component:
    
      <default-route>
        <service name="PD" unscoped_label="timer">
          <parent diag="yes"/>
        </service>
        ...
      </default-route>
    
    For subsystems based on a sub-init instance, init can be configured
    to report the capability-quota information of its subsystems by
    adding the attribute 'child_caps="yes"' to init's '<report>'
    config node. Init's own capability quota can be reported by adding
    the attribute 'init_caps="yes"'.

    The 'Ram_allocator' interface contains the subset of the RAM session
    interface that is needed to satisfy the needs of the 'Heap' and
    'Sliced_heap'. Its small size makes it ideal for intercepting memory
    allocations as done by the new 'Constrained_ram_allocator' wrapper
    class, which is meant to replace the existing 'base/allocator_guard.h'
    and 'os/ram_session_guard.h'.

Explicit execution of static constructors
=========================================

Author: Christian Helmuth <christian.helmuth@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 15 15:40:55 2017 +0100

    ldso: defer execution of static constructors
    
    Ldso now does not automatically execute static constructors of the
    binary and shared libraries the binary depends on. If static
    construction is required (e.g., if a shared library with constructor is
    used or a compilation unit contains global statics) the component needs
    to execute the constructors explicitly in Component::construct() via
    Genode::Env::exec_static_constructors().
    
    In the case of libc components this is done by the libc startup code
    (i.e., the Component::construct() implementation in the libc).
    
    The loading of shared objects at runtime is not affected by this change
    and constructors of those objects are executed immediately.
    
    Fixes #2332

    init: respond to binary-name changes
    
    This patch covers the resolution of the ROM route for child binaries
    via the generic label-rewriting mechanics. Now, the <binary> node has
    become merely sytactic sugar for a route like the following:
    
    <start name="test"/>
      <route>
        <service name="ROM" unscoped_label="test">
          <parent label="test-binary-name"/> </service>
          ...
      </route>
      ...
    </start>
    
    A change of the binary name has an effect on the child's ROM route to
    the binary and thereby implicitly triggers a child restart due to the
    existing re-validation of the routing.

    init: apply changes of <provides> nodes
    
    This patch enables init to apply changes of any server's <provides>
    declarations in a differential way. Servers can in principle be extended
    by new services without re-starting them. Of course, changes of the
    <provides> declarations may affect clients or would-be clients as this
    information is taken into account for the session routing.

    init: respond to RAM-quota changes in config
    
    This patch improves init's dynamic reconfigurability with respect to
    adjustments of the RAM quota assigned to the children.
    
    If the RAM quota is decreased, init withdraws as much quota from the
    child's RAM session as possible. If the child's RAM session does not
    have enough available quota, a resource-yield request is issued to
    the child. Cooparative children may respond to such a request by
    releasing memory.
    
    If the RAM quota is increased, the child's RAM session is upgraded.
    If the configuration exceeds init's available RAM, init re-attempts
    the upgrade whenever new slack memory becomes available (e.g., by
    disappearing other children).

    init: explicit response to resource requests
    
    This patch removes the formerly built-in policy of responding to
    resource requests with handing out slack quota. Instead, resource
    requests have to be answered by an update of the init configuration with
    adjusted quota values.
    
    Note that this patch may break run scripts that depend on init's
    original policy. Those run scripts may be adjusted by increasing the
    quota for the components that use to inflate their RAM usage during
    runtime such that the specified quota suffices for the entire lifetime
    of the component.

    init: service forwarding
    
    This patch equips init with the ability to act as a server that forwards
    session requests to its children. Session requests can be routed
    depending of the requested service type and the session label
    originating from init's parent.
    
    The feature is configured by one or multiple <service> nodes hosted in
    init's <config> node. The routing policy is selected by via the regular
    server-side policy-selection mechanism, for example:
    
    <config>
      ...
      <service name="LOG">
        <policy label="noux">
          <child name="terminal_log" label="important"/>
        </policy>
        <default-policy> <child name="nitlog"/> </default-policy>
      </service>
      ...
    </config>
    
    Each policy node must have a <child> sub node, which denotes name of the
    server with the 'name' attribute. The optional 'label' attribute defines
    the session label presented to the server, analogous to how the
    rewriting of session labels works in session routes. If not specified,
    the client-provided label is presented to the server as is.

Interpolated wall-clock times
=============================

commit 12b006286797e16db54d75aaa7b48b3abbe671d9
Author: Martin Stein <martin.stein@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 22 00:52:23 2017 +0200

    os/timer: interpolate time via timestamps
    
    Previously, the Genode::Timer::curr_time always used the
    Timer_session::elapsed_ms RPC as back end.  Now, Genode::Timer reads
    this remote time only in a periodic fashion independently from the calls
    to Genode::Timer::curr_time. If now one calls Genode::Timer::curr_time,
    the function takes the last read remote time value and adapts it using
    the timestamp difference since the remote-time read. The conversion
    factor from timestamps to time is estimated on every remote-time read
    using the last read remote-time value and the timestamp difference since
    the last remote time read.
    
    This commit also re-works the timeout test. The test now has two stages.
    In the first stage, it tests fast polling of the
    Genode::Timer::curr_time. This stage checks the error between locally
    interpolated and timer-driver time as well as wether the locally
    interpolated time is monotone and sufficiently homogeneous. In the
    second stage several periodic and one-shot timeouts are scheduled at
    once. This stage checks if the timeouts trigger sufficiently precise.
    
    This commit adds the new Kernel::time syscall to base-hw. The syscall is
    solely used by the Genode::Timer on base-hw as substitute for the
    timestamp. This is because on ARM, the timestamp function uses the ARM
    performance counter that stops counting when the WFI (wait for
    interrupt) instruction is active. This instruction, however is used by
    the base-hw idle contexts that get active when no user thread needs to
    be scheduled.  Thus, the ARM performance counter is not a good choice for
    time interpolation and we use the kernel internal time instead.
    
    With this commit, the timeout library becomes a basic library. That means
    that it is linked against the LDSO which then provides it to the program it
    serves. Furthermore, you can't use the timeout library anymore without the
    LDSO because through the kernel-dependent LDSO make-files we can achieve a
    kernel-dependent timeout implementation.
    
    This commit introduces a structured Duration type that shall successively
    replace the use of Microseconds, Milliseconds, and integer types for duration
    values.
    
    Open issues:
    
    * The timeout test fails on Raspberry PI because of precision errors in the
      first stage. However, this does not render the framework unusable in general
      on the RPI but merely is an issue when speaking of microseconds precision.
    
    * If we run on ARM with another Kernel than HW the timestamp speed may
      continuously vary from almost 0 up to CPU speed. The Timer, however,
      only uses interpolation if the timestamp speed remained stable (12.5%
      tolerance) for at least 3 observation periods. Currently, one period is
      100ms, so its 300ms. As long as this is not the case,
      Timer_session::elapsed_ms is called instead.
    
      Anyway, it might happen that the CPU load was stable for some time so
      interpolation becomes active and now the timestamp speed drops. In the
      worst case, we would now have 100ms of slowed down time. The bad thing
      about it would be, that this also affects the timeout of the period.
      Thus, it might "freeze" the local time for more than 100ms.
    
      On the other hand, if the timestamp speed suddenly raises after some
      stable time, interpolated time can get too fast. This would shorten the
      period but nonetheless may result in drifting away into the far future.
      Now we would have the problem that we can't deliver the real time
      anymore until it has caught up because the output of Timer::curr_time
      shall be monotone. So, effectively local time might "freeze" again for
      more than 100ms.
    
      It would be a solution to not use the Trace::timestamp on ARM w/o HW but
      a function whose return value causes the Timer to never use
      interpolation because of its stability policy.

    base: remove include/spec/* other than ISA
    
    This commit moves the headers residing in `repos/base/include/spec/*/drivers`
    to `repos/base/include/drivers/defs` or repos/base/include/drivers/uart`
    respectively. The first one contains definitions about board-specific MMIO
    iand RAM addresses, or IRQ lines. While the latter contains device driver
    code for UART devices. Those definitions are used by driver implementations
    in `repos/base-hw`, `repos/os`, and `repos/dde-linux`, which now need to
    include them more explicitely.
    
    This work is a step in the direction of reducing 'SPEC' identifiers overall.

    mk: strip binaries at <build-dir>/bin/
    
    The <build-dir>/bin/ directory used to contain symbolic links to the
    unstripped build results. However, since the upcoming depot tool
    extracts the content of binary archives from bin/, the resulting
    archives would contain overly large unstripped binaries, which is
    undesired. On the other hand, always stripping the build results is not
    a good option either because we rely of symbol information during
    debugging.
    
    This patch changes the installation of build results such that a new
    'debug/' directory is populated besides the existing 'bin/' directory.
    The debug directory contains symbolic links to the unstripped build
    results whereas the bin directory contains stripped binaries that are
    palatable for packaging (depot tool) and for assembling boot images (run
    tool).
